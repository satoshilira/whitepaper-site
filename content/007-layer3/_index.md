 Layer 3 (L3) represents a critical component of the
Satoshi LIRA ecosystem, designed to actively serve the economy of its
members by fostering direct connections between businesses and
customers on the web3 platform. In this section, we will explore the
objectives and benefits of Layer 3, focusing on reducing transaction
costs and integrating seamlessly into daily life.

**Integration of Web3 projects**

Web3 projects seeking to be part of
the LIRA ecosystem and its Layer3 (L3) will have the opportunity to
integrate and become a vital component of L3 LIRA. By integrating Web3
projects into the larger LIRA ecosystem, users can directly benefit
from each project launched within the LIRA ecosystem through staking
mechanisms.

**Benefits of Integration**

Web3 projects that are successfully
integrated into the LIRA ecosystem will gain exposure to a vibrant and
engaged community. Through staking, users will directly participate in
and benefit from the growth and success of projects born within the
LIRA ecosystem and its Layer3. This integration fosters collaboration,
innovation, and the overall expansion of the LIRA ecosystem.
