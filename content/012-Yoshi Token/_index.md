The Yoshi Token serves as the fundamental element of the democratic,
decentralized, and free governance system within the LIRA ecosystem.
With a total fixed supply of 210,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 YOSHI
tokens, the distribution of tokens is structured as follows:


     5%  Team LIRA         -  10,500,000,000,000,000,000,000   (1.05x10^22)    (pre-minted)
     5%  Liquidity         -  10,500,000,000,000,000,000,000   (1.05x10^22)    (pre-minted)
    10%  Pre-sale          -  21,000,000,000,000,000,000,000    (2.1x10^22)    (pre-minted)
    20%  Airdrop           -  42,000,000,000,000,000,000,000    (4.2x10^22)    (pre-minted)
    60%  Incentive Staking - 126,000,000,000,000,000,000,000   (1.26x10^23)

**Minting Mechanism**

The minting process for YOSHI tokens follows a
specific pattern. Initially, 13,808,219,200,000 YOSHI tokens are
minted per block. Subsequently, the block production undergoes a
halving event each time 50% of the remaining coins to be minted are
reached.

**Governance through YOSHI Tokens**

The YOSHI token assumes the role
of a governance token, granting holders the power to participate in
decision-making processes within the LIRA ecosystem. When a proposal
is presented to the community, users can actively engage in the voting
process by depositing their YOSHI tokens into the relevant vault
associated with the proposal. The LIRA protocol conducts the voting,
and the proposal with the highest number of votes is declared the
winner.

**Voting Incentives**

To encourage active participation and
engagement in the governance process, a unique voting incentive
mechanism is implemented. Users who voted for rejected proposals
receive 80% of their YOSHI tokens back, effectively allowing them to
retain the majority of their voting stake.

The remaining 20% of the YOSHI tokens used for rejected proposals are
distributed as follows: 80% goes to users who voted for the approved
proposal in the form of an airdrop, and 20% is divided between the
LIRA team and the LIRA ecosystem, with a 10% allocation to the team
and a 90% allocation to the ecosystem.

**Empowering Community Decision-Making**

By utilizing the Yoshi Token
as the governance mechanism, the LIRA ecosystem ensures that all
significant decisions are made collectively by the community. This
democratic approach empowers users to actively shape the future
direction and development of the ecosystem, fostering transparency,
inclusivity, and decentralization.
