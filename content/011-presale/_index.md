The Satoshi LIRA presale and its tokens, LIRA / TBg / TBs / TBb and YOSHI, are structured into two distinct phases: the sacrifice
phase and the reward phase of sacrifice. This Presale is designed to establish a sound and ethical token economics from day zero,
aligning with the core mission of the LIRA team to create the first cryptocurrency with genuine and unequivocal intrinsic value.
Therefore, structuring the presale traditionally would undermine the fundamental concept of Satoshi LIRA as a BTC derivative.

**Sacrifice Phase**

The sacrifice phase consists of three sub-phases, each lasting one week, with a maximum amount of 1 wBTC that can be sacrificed per
sub-phase.
The first phase is called the sacrifice phase because users are required to visit our platform and sacrifice a desired amount of wBTC.
Depending on the sub-phase in which the sacrifice is made, users will receive a bonus when redeeming their sacrifice based on the 
corresponding sub-phase.

**Pricing Structure**

To further align with our mission and maintain the concept of Satoshi LIRA as a BTC derivative, we have set the pricing structure for each sub-phase.

The prices per 1 LIRA will be fixed as follows:

---

    First Sub-Phase: 1 Satoshi
    Second Sub-Phase: 1.6 Satoshi
    Third Sub-phase: 2 Satoshi

**Reward Phase of Sacrifice**

This phase is where the sacrifices made during the presale are rewarded based on the time and quantity of wBTC sacrificed.
Once the sacrifice phase concludes, the capital collected will be utilized by the protocol for liquidity provision activities,
activating the entire Satoshi LIRA ecosystem. The rewards generated from the liquidity provision activities, as explained in the
corresponding chapter, will be converted into wBTC and used to mint new LIRA. Throughout the reward phase of sacrifice, 50% of each
minted block will be utilized to reward users who made sacrifices in the order they were made.
Once all the sacrifices have been rewarded, the LIRA ecosystem reaches 100% efficiency, and all newly minted LIRA blocks are 
distributed throughout the ecosystem
