The name Satoshi LIRA comes out from the idea to give to a cryptocurrency an intrinsic value in bitcoin.
As anticipated in the introduction, the store of value in bitcoin is used by the protocol to generate the LIRA derivative on a 1 Satoshi / 1 LIRA ratio, this means that 0.00000001 BTC has to enter the store of value to let the emission of 1 new LIRA possible.

This process is automatically controlled by a smart contract, which authorizes the mint of LIRA when bitcoins are put in the store of value.

A smart contract designed this way prevents unhautorized or incorrect access to the store of value or that malicious third party entities could create new supply without maintaining the counter value ratio.
