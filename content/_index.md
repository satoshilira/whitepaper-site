<h1>Satoshi LIRA</h1>

is a revolutionary project whose protocol makes it possible to generate profit from decentralized finance by acting as an engine for the creation of a democratic ecosystem, oriented towards the complete political and economic independence of its own people.


The liquidity provider activity is the core business of the Satoshi LIRA protocol.
Acting as liquidity provider, the protocol is able to provide a yield that is not dependant on transaction fees.
The value generated in this way is converted into BTC and locked in a vault to create the LIRA derivative with a ratio of

<h5>1 LIRA = 1 SATOSHI</h5>

The basic concept is that is not possible to mint LIRA if the equivalent in BTC is not locked in the store of value.
The aim is to finally create a BTC derivative designed to guarantee economic and political freedom applicable to everyday life.

The economic-digital transition that the world is undergoing acts as a catalyst for the people's need to have a currency with intrinsic BTC value and detached from the traditional economy, which would allow them to have decision-making power and indirectly profit from the new economy.

The use of native BTC as the currency for everyday needs would be too complex and expensive to be sustainable, hence the need for the creation of the LIRA derivative.

All the wealth automatically generated by the protocol is redistributed to community members, who are being actively part of the ecosystem through staking, liquidity providing and possession of "Treasury Bond Tokens".
