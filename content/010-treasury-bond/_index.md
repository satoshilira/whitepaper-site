**Introduction to TREASURY BOND Tokens (TB)**

Treasury Bond (TB) tokens play a crucial role in amplifying the value
of the LIRA ecosystem. These tokens have an intrinsic value in
LIRA DAO Coins (LDC), guaranteed by smart contracts, and serve as a mechanism to
enhance the stability and strength of the ecosystem. With a burn
mechanism in place and the freedom to interact with the smart
contract, TB token holders have the power to increase the intrinsic
value of their holdings and withdraw LIRA Dao Coins as needed.

**Types of TB Tokens**

There are three types of TB Tokens, each
representing a specific portion of the LDC supply:

    TBg (gold)   = 100.000.000.00 LDC
    TBs (silver) =   1.000.000,00 LDC
    TBb (bronze)=     100.000,00 LDC

**Strategic Inflation and Deflation of LIRA DAO Coin Supply**

TB tokens hold a strategic function within the ecosystem, allowing for
the inflation or deflation of the circulating supply of LDC based on
the needs of the ecosystem. Through voting on the decentralized
autonomous organization (DAO), participants can determine the
percentages of division of LIRA for the creation of TB tokens, thereby
influencing the amount of LIRA DAO Coin circulating. This governance mechanism
ensures that the ecosystem remains adaptable and responsive to the
changing needs of its participants.

**Creation of TB Tokens from LIDA DAO Coin Blocks**

When new LDC are created, they are divided for the creation of TB tokens.
In this process, 80% of the new LIRA DAO Coin block is allocated to the
creation of TB tokens. 
The division of LIRA DAO Coin sent to create TB tokens is distributed as follows:

    50% for TB Gold creation
    30% for TB Silver creation
    20% for TB Bronze creation.

The LDC used for minting TB Tokens are locked within a
designated vault, ensuring their secure storage.

**TB Tokenomic Distribution**

The distribution of TB tokens and their associated benefits is
structured as follows:

    40% is allocated to TB LP staking, promoting liquidity provision and
        facilitating efficient trading within the ecosystem.
    35% goes to the LIRA ecosystem reward division, incentivizing
        ecosystem participants and contributing to its overall growth.
    10% is allocated to the LIRA DAO Fund
    10% is allocated to the LIRA team, ensuring ongoing development,
        support, and maintenance of the ecosystem.
    5% is allocated to green energy social mining producers


**Ensuring Stability and Support**

Through the LIRA reserve, the ecosystem aims to bolster the
stability and strength of the LIRA DAO Coin currency, providing additional
stability for LDC holders. The DAO's emergency fund serves as a
safety net, enabling the ecosystem to intervene and support members
during global emergencies. Managed through voting by the DAO, the
emergency fund provides immediate assistance to ecosystem participants
in times of difficulty.

The implementation of Treasury Bond (TB) tokens within the
LIRA ecosystem introduces a dynamic mechanism for amplifying its
value. With intrinsic value guaranteed by smart contracts, TB tokens
empower participants to increase the intrinsic value of their holdings
and interact with the smart contract to withdraw LIRA DAO Coins. Strategic
voting within the DAO allows for the inflation or deflation of the
LDC circulating supply based on the needs of the ecosystem. The
creation of TB tokens from LDC blocks further contributes to the
ecosystem's stability and growth.
