In the context of the LIRA DAO ecosystem, our decentralized exchange (DEX) platform requires integration with the Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency to facilitate seamless transactions among ecosystem participants. In this chapter, we will explore the functionality of LIRA Ethereum (LETH) and its role within the ecosystem.

**Contract Structure**

Similar to the contractual structure of the Satoshi LIRA digital currency, the LETH contract binds ETH and guarantees a 1 to 1 issuance ratio of LETH. This means that users can convert ETH into LETH at any time and, if desired, burn their LETH to retrieve ETH.

**The Concept of Bridge and How LETH Works**

A "bridge" is a mechanism that connects two different blockchains or networks, enabling the transfer of assets from one blockchain to another. In the context of LIRA, LETH serves as a "bridge" between the Ethereum blockchain and the LIRA blockchain.

The LETH contract functions by binding ETH on the Ethereum blockchain and securely generating a corresponding amount of LETH on the LIRA blockchain. This process ensures that each unit of circulating LETH has an equivalent in ETH on the Ethereum blockchain.

Users have the flexibility to convert their cryptocurrency between the two blockchains bidirectionally. They can transform ETH into LETH when needed, and if desired, burn their LETH to retrieve ETH back on the Ethereum blockchain. This process is designed to be smooth and seamless, enabling easy interaction between the two blockchains through the LETH mechanism, which represents a "wrapped Ethereum" on the LIRA blockchain.

In essence, LETH functions as a bridge that securely and reliably connects the two blockchains, facilitating the conversion and transfer of value between the Satoshi LIRA ecosystem and the Ethereum network.
