In the crytpo sector, a Launchpad refers to a platform or service that helps new cryptocurrency projects launch their initial coin offerings (ICOs), initial exchange offerings (IEOs), or other forms of fundraising events. Launchpads provide a suite of services to crypto startups that typically include due diligence, marketing, fundraising, and community-building support.
Launchpads typically work as intermediaries between crypto startups and potential investors. They vet and select promising crypto projects that meet their criteria for quality and potential, then provide them with access to their investor networks. In return, launchpads receive a fee or a share of the tokens issued during the fundraising event. Launchpads can be hosted on centralized or decentralized platforms, depending on their specific architecture and approach.
Overall, launchpads have become an increasingly popular way for crypto projects to raise funds, build a community, and gain exposure to the wider crypto market. At the same, they offer investors the opportunity to invest in promising new projects at an early stage and potentially reap significant rewards if the project succeeds.
