The Launchpad is an integral component of the LIRA
ecosystem, providing a platform for companies and projects seeking to
join and contribute to the vibrant decentralized exchange (DEX)
environment. This section outlines the functionalities and benefits of
the Launchpad, including presales and integration opportunities for
Web3 projects.

**Presale Participation**

The Launchpad offers various presales where
community members with active TB (Treasury Bonds) staking on the
platform can participate. Presales are chosen through a voting process
conducted by the LIRA DAO community, ensuring a transparent and
democratic selection of projects to be launched.

The Launchpad serves as a gateway for companies and
projects to join the LIRA ecosystem, enabling presales and integration
opportunities for Web3 projects. Through the presale mechanism,
community members with active TB Tokens staking can participate in token
sales, fostering a fair and inclusive environment. The Launchpad not
only empowers investors to support promising projects but also
establishes a solid foundation for future growth within the LIRA
ecosystem. By integrating Web3 projects into the larger ecosystem,
users can directly benefit from the successes of these projects
through staking mechanisms, contributing to the overall strength and
vibrancy of the LIRA community. The Launchpad represents a key
component of LIRA's commitment to innovation, collaboration, and the
democratization of the cryptocurrency sector.
