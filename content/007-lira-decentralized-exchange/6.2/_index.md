The Launchpad is an integral component of the LIRA
ecosystem, providing a platform for companies and projects seeking to
join and contribute to the vibrant decentralized exchange (DEX)
environment. This section outlines the functionalities and benefits of
the Launchpad, including presales and integration opportunities for
Web3 projects.

**Presale Participation**

The Launchpad offers various presales where
community members with active TBT (LIRA Treasury Bonds) staking on the
platform can participate. Presales are chosen through a voting process
conducted by the LIRA DAO community, ensuring a transparent and
democratic selection of projects to be launched.

**Presale Mechanics**

During a presale, the project's tokens are
made available for purchase at a base price of $1, with the token
supply cap determined by the project itself. Community members can
contribute funds to the presale, and if the funds raised either exceed
or fall below the 1:1 token-to-dollar ratio, the sale will continue
until the set time limit expires.

**Token Distribution**

At the conclusion of the presale, the
project's tokens will be distributed proportionally to the investors
based on the funds raised. The value achieved during the presale will
be the starting value for the tokens in the exchange pools. For
example, if the presale supply is 100,000 tokens and $200,000 is
raised, an investor who purchased $1,000 worth of tokens can receive
500 tokens, considering the final presale value of $2 each. This
establishes the initial exchange pool for the Token/LIRA pair at a 1:2
token-to-dollar ratio. Each presale will have LIRA as the fixed pair
in the exchange pools.

The Launchpad serves as a gateway for companies and
projects to join the LIRA ecosystem, enabling presales and integration
opportunities for Web3 projects. Through the presale mechanism,
community members with active TB Tokens staking can participate in token
sales, fostering a fair and inclusive environment. The Launchpad not
only empowers investors to support promising projects but also
establishes a solid foundation for future growth within the LIRA
ecosystem. By integrating Web3 projects into the larger ecosystem,
users can directly benefit from the successes of these projects
through staking mechanisms, contributing to the overall strength and
vibrancy of the LIRA community. The Launchpad represents a key
component of LIRA's commitment to innovation, collaboration, and the
democratization of the cryptocurrency sector.
