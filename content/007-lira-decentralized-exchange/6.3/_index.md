Within the LIRA DAO ecosystem, our decentralized exchange (DEX) platform requires integration with the Bitcoin (BTC) cryptocurrency to enable seamless transactions among ecosystem participants. In this chapter, we will delve into the functionality of LIRA Bitcoin (LBTC) and its role within the ecosystem.

**Contract Structure**

The LBTC contract binds BTC and ensures a secure issuance ratio of LBTC. Users can convert BTC into LBTC at any time and, if desired, burn their LBTC to retrieve BTC.

**The Concept of Bridge and How LBTC Works with Bitcoin**

In contrast to the Ethereum bridge mechanism, LBTC operates as a bridge between the LIRA blockchain and the Bitcoin network. This involves a different approach due to the distinctive nature of the Bitcoin blockchain.

The LBTC contract securely locks BTC on the Bitcoin network and issues a corresponding amount of LBTC on the LIRA blockchain. Each unit of LBTC in circulation is backed by an equivalent amount of BTC on the Bitcoin network.

Users enjoy flexibility in converting their cryptocurrency bidirectionally between the two networks. They can convert BTC into LBTC when needed and, if desired, burn their LBTC to retrieve BTC on the Bitcoin network. This process is designed for a seamless and efficient experience, facilitating smooth interaction between the LIRA ecosystem and the Bitcoin network through the LBTC mechanism.

In essence, LBTC acts as a bridge, ensuring a secure and reliable connection between the LIRA blockchain and the Bitcoin network, facilitating the conversion and transfer of value within the Satoshi LIRA ecosystem and the broader Bitcoin network.
