A rebase token mechanism is a method used to adjust the circulating supply of a cryptocurrency token based on changes in its price in relation to a specified asset or index. The goal is to maintain the token's price stability and reduce volatility by controlling the circulating supply of tokens in response to changes in demand.
In a rebase token mechanism, the token's supply is adjusted periodically, usually on a daily or hourly basis, to align its price with the price of the asset it is tracking. If the token's price is higher than the asset it is tracking, the mechanism will reduce the circulating supply of the token. Conversely, if the token's price is lower than the asset it is tracking, the mechanism will increase the circulating supply of the token.
This adjustment in the token supply is done in a way that doesn't affect the individual holdings of a token holders, as the proportion of tokens owned by each holder remains the same. However, the overall supply of the token will change, and the change will be reflected in the token's price.
Rebase tokens are often used in decentralized exchanges (DeXs) to allow investors to invest in traditional market assets using their cryptocurrencies. By using rebase tokens, investors can gain exposure to traditional assets without having to convert their cryptocurrencies into fiat currency.
