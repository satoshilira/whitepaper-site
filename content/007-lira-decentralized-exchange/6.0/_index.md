Within the Satoshi LIRA ecosystem, our decentralized exchange (DEX) platform
requires integration with the Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency to facilitate seamless
transactions among ecosystem participants. In this chapter, we will explore the functionality
of LIRA Ethereum (LETH) and its role within the ecosystem.

**Contract Structure**

Similar to the contractual structure of the Satoshi LIRA digital currency, the LETH contract 
binds ETH and guarantees a 1 to 1 issuance ratio of LETH.
This means that users can convert ETH into LETH at any time and, if desired, burn their LETH to retrieve ETH.

**Utilization of Raised Funds**

The ETH collected through the LETH contract will be used to power a validation node and support mining activities
to generate you ETH. These newly generated ETH will then be locked within the LETH contract to enhance its intrinsic value

**Benefits for LETH Holders**

LETH holders can benefit from the Satoshi LIRA ecosystem and its components by possessing a derivative of ETH secured
by a smart contract. By burning their LETH, holders will receive a greater quantity of ETH than initially
converted, providing them with an advantage in the overall value of their transactions.

LETH represents an opportunity for the entire Satoshi LIRA ecosystem and its participants to benefit from owning
a derivative of ETH guaranteed by a smart contract. Through a mathematically driven approach, the LETH contract
ensures a continuous increase in the intrinsic value of the cryptocurrency denominated in ETH, offering 
additional incentives for users to actively engage with the Satoshi LIRA ecosystem.
