**Introduction to LIRA TREASURY BOND Tokens (LTB)**

LIRA Treasury Bond (LTB) tokens play a crucial role in amplifying the value
of the Satoshi LIRA ecosystem. These tokens have an intrinsic value in
Satoshi LIRA token, guaranteed by smart contracts, and serve as a mechanism to
enhance the stability and strength of the ecosystem. With a burn
mechanism in place and the freedom to interact with the smart
contract, LTB token holders have the power to increase the intrinsic
value of their holdings and withdraw LIRA tokens as needed.

**Types of LTB Tokens**

There are three types of LTB Tokens, each
representing a specific portion of the LIRA supply:

    LTBg (gold)   = 100.000.000.00 LIRA
    LTBs (silver) =   1.000.000,00 LIRA
    LTBb (bronze)=     100.000,00 LIRA

**Strategic Inflation and Deflation of Satoshi LIRA Supply**

LTB tokens hold a strategic function within the ecosystem, allowing for
the inflation or deflation of the circulating supply of Satoshi LIRA tokens based on
the needs of the ecosystem. Through voting on the decentralized
autonomous organization (DAO), participants can determine the
percentages of division of LIRA for the creation of LTB tokens, thereby
influencing the amount of LIRA circulating. This governance mechanism
ensures that the ecosystem remains adaptable and responsive to the
changing needs of its participants.

**Creation of LTB Tokens from Satoshi LIRA Blocks**

When new LIRA tokens are created, they are divided for the creation of LTB tokens.
In this process, 80% of the new LIRA block is allocated to the
creation of LTB tokens. 
The division of LIRA sent to create LTB tokens is distributed as follows:

    50% for LTB Gold creation
    30% for LTB Silver creation
    20% for LTB Bronze creation.

The LIRA tokens used for minting LTB Tokens are locked within a
designated vault, ensuring their secure storage.

**LTB Tokenomic Distribution**

The distribution of LTB tokens and their associated benefits is
structured as follows:

    40% is allocated to LTB LP staking, promoting liquidity provision and
        facilitating efficient trading within the ecosystem.
    35% goes to the LIRA ecosystem reward division, incentivizing
        ecosystem participants and contributing to its overall growth.
    10% is allocated to the LIRA DAO Fund
    10% is allocated to the LIRA team, ensuring ongoing development,
        support, and maintenance of the ecosystem.
    5% is allocated to green energy social mining producers


**Ensuring Stability and Support**

Through the Satoshi LIRA reserve, the ecosystem aims to bolster the
stability and strength of the LIRA currency, providing additional
stability for LIRA holders. The DAO's emergency fund serves as a
safety net, enabling the ecosystem to intervene and support members
during global emergencies. Managed through voting by the DAO, the
emergency fund provides immediate assistance to ecosystem participants
in times of difficulty.

The implementation of LIRA Treasury Bond (LTB) tokens within the Satoshi
LIRA ecosystem introduces a dynamic mechanism for amplifying its
value. With intrinsic value guaranteed by smart contracts, LTB tokens
empower participants to increase the intrinsic value of their holdings
and interact with the smart contract to withdraw LIRA tokens. Strategic
voting within the DAO allows for the inflation or deflation of the
LIRA circulating supply based on the needs of the ecosystem. The
creation of LTB tokens from LIRA blocks further contributes to the
ecosystem's stability and growth.
