Every time an amount of BTC is collected in the value reserve under a smart contract, a new block of LIRA is minted.
Based on the ratio between the number of BTC locked in the contract and the LIRA supply, the starting ratio is 1 LIRA to 1 SATOSHI.

<h3>1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC</h3>

<h3>Intrinsic value LIRA = 1 Satoshi</h3>

---

From each block of minted LIRA, 1% of the total is Burned.
80% of the minted LIRA, after the 1% initial burn, is set aside for minting TB tokens and the 20% is distributed in the LIRA ecosystem.
The percentage of LIRA introduced into the ecosystem will undergo an additional 4% burn.

The distribution of the remaining LIRA following the initial divisions occurs as follow:

    LIRA Treasury Bond (TB) Token Staking = 50%
                                     TEAM = 15%                              
                         Liquidity Mining = 20%
                              Development =  5%
                              Unallocated =  4%
                Financing / DAO Decisions =  3%
                                    Costs =  2%
                                Marketing =  1%
