LIRA DAO TOKEN (LDT) Presale on Arbitrum:

The LIRA DAO TOKEN (LDT) presale on the Arbitrum network represents a pivotal phase in the initiation of the LIRA ecosystem. Structured into four tranches, each extending over a duration of 10 days, this presale offers early participants an exclusive opportunity to engage with the foundational components of the platform.

Throughout the duration of the presale, bonus allocations are contingent upon the timing of acquisition. Participants will receive a 15% bonus during the initial week, followed by a 10% bonus in the subsequent week, a 5% bonus in the third week, and no bonus allocation in the final week. This tiered incentive mechanism is designed to encourage early participation and facilitate a gradual distribution of tokens.

The acquisition of LDT tokens will be facilitated directly through the LIRA platform, ensuring a streamlined and secure process for participants. Upon the conclusion of the presale period, liquidity pools will be activated on the LIRA Decentralized Exchange (DEx) on the Arbitrum network, augmenting liquidity and accessibility for LDT holders.

A total supply of 10 billion LDT tokens will be minted on Arbitrum, with 1 billion tokens earmarked for the presale phase. The breakdown of this allocation is as follows: 85% will be available for purchase by the general public during the presale, 10% will be allocated for marketing purposes, and 5% will be reserved for the development team. Any surplus tokens remaining unsold at the conclusion of the presale will be subject to a burn mechanism, thereby establishing a protocol for managing token scarcity and preserving value.

The remaining 9 billion LDT tokens will continue to exist on the Arbitrum network. These tokens will be strategically allocated to incentivize platform participation on Arbitrum until the transition to LIRA CHAIN. This allocation is devised to stimulate user engagement and facilitate the establishment of a vibrant and participatory community ecosystem. Users who wish to migrate their LDT tokens to the LIRA CHAIN will have the option to do so through a bridge mechanism, transforming them into LIRA DAO COIN (LDC) on the LIRA CHAIN. This bridge mechanism enables seamless interoperability between the Arbitrum network and the LIRA CHAIN, allowing users to leverage the benefits of both ecosystems.

Priced at 0.000004 ETH per LDT, the presale presents early participants with an opportunity to acquire tokens at an initial valuation, positioning themselves favorably for potential future appreciation within the evolving LIRA ecosystem.

Participation in the LDT presale serves as an invitation to partake in the foundational stages of the LIRA ecosystem. Through the acquisition of LDT tokens, participants gain access to a nascent decentralized financial infrastructure, embodying the principles of decentralization and community governance that underpin the LIRA project.
