Lira Treasury Bonds, or TB Tokens, are the tools that the LIRA ecosystem uses to deflate the circulating supply of LIRA and, in any case, make free trade possible for the owners of these values.

The are three types of TB tokens: TBg(gold), TBs(silver), TBb(bronze). 

Each TB token represents a portion of the LIRA supply according to this list:

    TBg = 10.000.000,00 LIRA
    TBs =  1.000.000,00 LIRA
    TBb =    100.000,00 LIRA
