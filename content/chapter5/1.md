The creation of the TB tokens, as mentioned before, takes place after the minting of the LIRA mother block, and therefore having locked the BTC amount in the vault.
Once the new LIRA have been issued, 80% is allocated to the minting of TB tokens with the following proportion:

    50% in TBb Tokens
    30% in TBs Tokens
    20% in TBg Tokens

The LIRA used for the minting of the TB tokens are also locked in a vault.
