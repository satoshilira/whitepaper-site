The Satoshi LIRA protocol is primarily focused on serving as a
liquidity provider within the cryptocurrency sector. By carefully
selecting liquidity pools based on risk assessment and generated
Annual Percentage Rate (APR), the protocol aims to optimize capital
allocation and generate substantial returns.

**Capital Allocation**

To ensure efficient capital utilization, the
Satoshi LIRA protocol employs a meticulous process for selecting the
most suitable liquidity pools. The selection criteria include factors
such as risk evaluation and the potential APR offered by each pool. By
strategically allocating capital across multiple pools, the protocol
maximizes the opportunities for generating significant returns.

**Rewards collection and allocation**

Once capital is allocated to
various liquidity pools, the Satoshi LIRA protocol diligently collects
the rewards generated by these pools on a daily basis. The collected
rewards are then carefully distributed among the participants of the
protocol, ensuring fair and equitable allocation.

**BTC Conversion and LIRA Minting**

Upon rewards collection, 70% of
the rewards obtained from liquidity provision activities are converted
into Bitcoin (BTC). These BTC rewards undergo the process previously
described in the white paper, where they are locked securely in the
Vault through the smart contract. Subsequently, these BTC assets serve
as the basis for minting new LIRA tokens, which are then distributed
to active participants of the Satoshi LIRA protocol.

**Compounding Mechanism**

To further optimize the growth of capital
employed in liquidity provision, 20% of the collected rewards are
allocated towards enhancing positions in existing liquidity pools or
exploring opportunities in new pools. This compounding mechanism
enables the protocol to compound its earnings, potentially leading to
greater overall returns over time.

**Team Rewards**

In recognition of their contributions and efforts in
developing and maintaining the Satoshi LIRA protocol, the team retains
10% of the collected rewards in the form of native coins. This
allocation ensures the team's continued dedication and support in
advancing the project's goals and sustaining the protocol's long-term
success.

The Satoshi LIRA protocol distinguishes itself as an
innovative liquidity provider within the cryptocurrency sector. By
strategically selecting liquidity pools, optimizing capital
allocation, and compounding returns, the protocol generates
substantial rewards for participants. Through the process of
converting rewards into BTC and minting new LIRA tokens, the protocol
ensures the distribution of economic benefits to active members of the
Satoshi LIRA ecosystem. Additionally, the team's allocation of rewards
in the form of native coins further incentivizes their ongoing
commitment to the project's development. The Satoshi LIRA protocol
aims to revolutionize the cryptocurrency sector by creating a
democratic ecosystem that fosters economic and political independence
while providing a reliable and profitable liquidity provision
mechanism.
