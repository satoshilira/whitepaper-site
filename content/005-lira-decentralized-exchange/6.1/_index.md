The LIRA ecosystem introduces
a novel trading feature that allows users to trade rebase tokens
paired with commonly traded commodities. This innovative approach
provides users with the opportunity to diversify their portfolios and
engage in new trading strategies while benefitting from the inherent
stability of commodity-backed tokens.

 **Price Stability and Rebase Mechanism**

 Rebase tokens within the
LIRA ecosystem maintain price stability through a carefully designed
rebase mechanism. This mechanism adjusts the token's supply
periodically to ensure its value remains pegged to the underlying
commodity, thus providing users with a reliable and secure trading
experience.

**Trading Opportunities**

The introduction of rebase tokens paired
with commonly traded commodities opens up new avenues for trading and
investment within the LIRA ecosystem. Users can leverage the stability
and value appreciation potential of these tokens to diversify their
holdings and explore alternative trading strategies.
