The LIRA ecosystem offers a decentralized exchange (DEX) that enables
users to freely exchange cryptocurrencies while providing additional
features such as liquidity mining, staking, and the groundbreaking
trading of rebase tokens paired with commonly traded commodities.

The LIRA DEX serves as a secure and
transparent platform for users to trade a wide range of
cryptocurrencies. By leveraging decentralized technologies, the DEX
ensures user privacy, eliminates the need for intermediaries, and
fosters a trustless environment.

**Liquidity Provision and Fee Sharing**

The LIRA ecosystem
incentivizes users to provide liquidity to the available pools within
the DEX. By adding liquidity to these pools, users contribute to the
overall liquidity of the platform and facilitate seamless
transactions. In return, liquidity providers receive a percentage of
the fees collected from the swaps executed within the respective
pools.

**Staking and Rewards**

The LIRA platform utilizes the well known concept of
LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, which users receive when they
contribute liquidity to the pools. These LP tokens can be staked on
the platform, generating rewards in two forms: LIRA and CRT
(Commodities Rebase Token).

**LIRA Rewards**

Staking LP tokens on the LIRA platform allows
users to earn additional LIRA tokens as rewards. This incentivizes
long-term participation and strengthens the community's engagement
within the ecosystem.

**CRT Rewards**

In addition to LIRA rewards, LP token stakers also
have the opportunity to earn CRT (Commodities Rebase Token) rewards.
The CRT is an innovative token that is pegged to the value of commonly
traded commodities. The unique rebase mechanism of CRT ensures its
price stability and provides users with exposure to the commodities
market.
