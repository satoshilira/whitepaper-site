The distribution of newly minted LIRA tokens follows a structured
process that ensures both the preservation of value and the allocation
of tokens to key areas within the ecosystem. Each time an equivalent
amount of BTC is collected in the store of value under the smart
contracts, a block of new LIRA tokens is minted. As previously
mentioned, the minting ratio is set at 1 Satoshi to 1 LIRA.

**Intrinsic Value and Burning Mechanism**

The Satoshi LIRA protocol
The starting value of LIRA is fixed at 1 Satoshi, equivalent to
0.00000001 BTC. To support the preservation of value, 1% of the total
newly minted LIRA tokens from each block are burned. This burning
mechanism reduces the supply, thus creating scarcity and enhancing the
long-term value of LIRA in terms of BTC.

**Initial Division**

Following the burning of a portion of newly
minted LIRA tokens, the remaining amount is divided into different
allocations. Initially, 80% of the remaining LIRA tokens are set aside
for the minting of Treasury Bond (TB) tokens, which play a crucial
role in the ecosystem. The remaining 20% is distributed within the
LIRA ecosystem.

**Distribution Breakdown**

The distribution breakdown of the
remaining Satoshi LIRA tokens is as follows:


    LIRA Treasury Bond (TB) Token Staking = 40%
                                     TEAM = 15%                              
                               LP Staking = 20%
                   Green Energy Producers =  5%
                                 DAO Fund =  19%
                                Marketing =  1%


**LIRA Distribution Channels**

A significant portion, *40%* of the remaining LIRA tokens, is
allocated for LIRA Treasury Bond (TB) token staking. TB tokens provide
holders with the opportunity to stake their LIRA tokens and earn
additional rewards, thereby encouraging long-term engagement within
the Satoshi LIRA ecosystem.

A portion of *20%* of the remaining LIRA tokens
is dedicated to liquidity mining activities. This allocation
incentivizes liquidity providers to participate in the ecosystem,
contributing to the stability and liquidity of the Satoshi LIRA
protocol.

To recognize the ongoing contributions of the project
team, *15%* of the remaining LIRA tokens are allocated to the team. This
allocation ensures the team's continued commitment and dedication to
the development and success of the Satoshi LIRA protocol.

A significant portion of the minted LIRA tokens, specifically *5%* of the
distribution, is allocated to green energy producers. This allocation demonstrates
the committment of the Satoshi LIRA ecosystem to promote and support sustainable
practises whithin the cryptocurrency industry.

To facilitate the governance and decision-making processes within the Satoshi LIRA
ecosystem, *19%* of the remaining LIRA tokens are allocated for
Financing Dao services/decisions/expenses. This allocation empowers the
community to participate actively in shaping the future direction of
the project.

To ensure the growth and awareness of the Satoshi
LIRA project, *1%* of the remaining LIRA tokens are allocated for
marketing activities. These resources facilitate strategic marketing
campaigns, fostering adoption and attracting new participants to the
ecosystem.
