The distribution of newly minted LIRA DAO Coins (LDC) follows a structured
process that ensures the allocation
of tokens to key areas within the ecosystem. 


**Initial Division**

Following the burning of a portion of newly
minted LIRA tokens, the remaining amount is divided into different
allocations. Initially, 80% of the remaining LIRA DAO Coin are set aside
for the minting of Treasury Bond (TB) tokens, which play a crucial
role in the ecosystem. The remaining 20% is distributed within the
LIRA ecosystem.

**Distribution Breakdown**

The distribution breakdown of the
remaining LIRA DAO Coins is as follows:


    LIRA Treasury Bond (TB) Token Staking = 40%
                                     TEAM = 15%                              
                               LP Staking = 20%
                   Green Energy Producers =  5%
                                 DAO Fund =  19%
                                Marketing =  1%


**LIRA Distribution Channels**

A significant portion, *40%* of the remaining LDC, is
allocated for LIRA Treasury Bond (TB) token staking. TB tokens provide
holders with the opportunity to stake their LDC and earn
additional rewards, thereby encouraging long-term engagement within
the LIRA ecosystem.

A portion of *20%* of the remaining LDC
is dedicated to liquidity mining activities. This allocation
incentivizes liquidity providers to participate in the ecosystem,
contributing to the stability and liquidity of the LIRA
protocol.

To recognize the ongoing contributions of the project
team, *15%* of the remaining LDC are allocated to the team. This
allocation ensures the team's continued commitment and dedication to
the development and success of the LIRA protocol.

A significant portion of the minted LDC, specifically *5%* of the
distribution, is allocated to green energy producers. This allocation demonstrates
the committment of the LIRA ecosystem to promote and support sustainable
practises whithin the cryptocurrency industry.

To facilitate the governance and decision-making processes within the LIRA
ecosystem, *19%* of the remaining LDC are allocated for
Financing Dao services/decisions/expenses. This allocation empowers the
community to participate actively in shaping the future direction of
the project.

To ensure the growth and awareness of the LIRA project, *1%* of the remaining LDC are allocated for
marketing activities. These resources facilitate strategic marketing
campaigns, fostering adoption and attracting new participants to the
