Within the LIRA DeX, the launchpad will be made available for companies and projects that wish to become part of the LIRA ecosystem.
The launchpad will have various presales where all users with active TBT staking on the platform can participate.

For each presale, there will be a time-limited sale of the project's token that the LIRA DAO community has chosen to launch through a voting process.
During this time, community members can buy the proposed project's coins at a base price of $1 with a token supply cap decided by the project. If the funds raised exceed or are below the 1:1 token-to-dollar ratio, the sale will continue until the set time limit.

At the end of the presale, the tokens will be distributed proportionally to the investors based on the funds raised. The value reached during the presale will be the starting value in the exchange pools. For example, if the presale supply is 100,000 tokens, and the funds raised are $200,000, an investor who purchased $1,000 worth of tokens can receive 500 tokens, given the final presale value of $2 each. The exchange pool for Token/LIRA will be started at the same 1:2 token-to-dollar ratio, and each pool created for this purpose will have LIRA as the fixed pair.

Web3 projects that want to be part of the LIRA ecosystem and its Layer3 will be integrated and become the heart of L3 LIRA. The projects launched will be integrated into the entire LIRA ecosystem, and through staking, users will directly benefit from each project born on the LIRA ecosystem and its L3.
