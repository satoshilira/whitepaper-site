To fill one of the major gaps in the crypto sector, namely the inability to invest one's cryptocurrencies in traditional market assets, the LIRA DeX provides a token rebase system designed to emulate the price of certain commodities. The target value of these tokens is determined by an oracle that observes the price fluctuations of the relevant commodities in the traditional market. a pre-determined hourly rebasing mechanism is then applied to maintain the token's price fidelity to the reference commodity.

The rebasing mechanism, in order to keep the token price close to the referenced commodity, acts by modifying the circulating supply, either reducing or increasing the quantity of tokens in the wallets of the holders.
