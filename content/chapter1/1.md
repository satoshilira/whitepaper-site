The liquidity provider activity is the core business of the Satoshi LIRA protocol.
Acting as liquidity provider, the protocol is able to provide a yield that is not dependant on transaction fees.
The value generated in this way is converted into BTC and locked in a vault to create the LIRA derivative with a ratio of
<h4>1 LIRA = 1 SATOSHI</h4>


The basic concept is that is not possible to mint LIRA if the equivalent in BTC is not locked in the store of value.
The aim is to finally create a BTC derivative designed to guarantee economic and political freedom applicable to everyday life.
