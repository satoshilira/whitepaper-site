Lira Treasury Bonds, or TB Tokens, are the tools that the LIRA ecosystem uses to deflate the circulating supply of LIRA and, in any case, make free trade possible for the owners of these values.

The are three types of TB tokens: TBg(gold), TBs(silver), TBb(bronze). 

Each TB token represents a portion of the LIRA supply according to this list:

    TBg = 10.000.000,00 LIRA
    TBs =  1.000.000,00 LIRA
    TBb =    100.000,00 LIRA

The creation of the TB tokens takes place after the minting of the LIRA mother block, and therefore having locked the BTC amount in the vault.
Once the new LIRA have been issued, 80% is allocated to the minting of TB tokens with the following proportion:

    50% in TBb Tokens
    30% in TBs Tokens
    20% in TBg Tokens

The LIRA used for the minting of the TB tokens are also locked in a vault.



Every time new TB tokens are minted, a portion is burned through the burn mechanism, but the equivalent in LIRA remains within the contract. This ensure that the intrinsic value of LIRA steadily increases over time.


Every user can burn their TB tokens at any time and receive back the equivalent of their value in LIRA.
This allows every TB token holder to have the mathematical certainty that, in a completely passive manner, regardless of their activities within the Satoshi LIRA ecosystem, the intrinsic value of their TB token will constantly grow over time.
