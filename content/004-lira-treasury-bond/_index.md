Lira Treasury Bonds, or TB Tokens, are the tools that the LIRA ecosystem uses to deflate the circulating supply of LIRA and, in any case, make free trade possible for the owners of these values.

The are three types of TB tokens: TBg(gold), TBs(silver), TBb(bronze). 

Each TB token represents a portion of the LIRA supply according to this list:

    TBg = 10.000.000,00 LIRA
    TBs =  1.000.000,00 LIRA
    TBb =    100.000,00 LIRA

The creation of the TB tokens takes place after the minting of the LIRA mother block, and therefore having locked the BTC amount in the vault.
Once the new LIRA have been issued, 80% is allocated to the minting of TB tokens with the following proportion:

    50% in TBb Tokens
    30% in TBs Tokens
    20% in TBg Tokens

The LIRA used for the minting of the TB tokens are also locked in a vault.
