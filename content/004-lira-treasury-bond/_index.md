The LIRA Treasury Bonds (TB) Tokens play a crucial role in deflating
the circulating supply of LIRA and facilitating seamless trading for
holders within the LIRA ecosystem.

**Types of TB Tokens**

There are three types of TB Tokens, each
representing a specific portion of the LIRA supply:

    TBg = 10.000.000,00 LIRA
    TBs =  1.000.000,00 LIRA
    TBb =    100.000,00 LIRA

**Creation of TB Tokens**

The creation of TB Tokens occurs subsequent
to the minting of the LIRA mother block, after the corresponding BTC
amount has been locked in the vault. Once the new LIRA tokens are
issued, 80% of the newly minted LIRA is allocated to the creation of
TB Tokens, distributed in the following proportions:

    50% in TBb Tokens
    30% in TBs Tokens
    20% in TBg Tokens

The LIRA tokens used for minting TB Tokens are locked within a
designated vault, ensuring their secure storage.

**Maximizing Profit with TB Tokens**

Ownership of TB Tokens unlocks
the potential for maximizing profits within the LIRA ecosystem, as
explained in previous sections of this white paper. By holding TB
Tokens, participants gain enhanced access to the benefits and rewards
offered by the ecosystem, positioning them to capitalize on the growth
and value generated within the LIRA network.

LIRA Treasury Bonds (TB) Tokens are instrumental in
deflating the circulating supply of LIRA and facilitating trading for
holders. With three distinct types of TB Tokens representing varying
portions of the LIRA supply, the ecosystem ensures flexibility and
accessibility. By allocating a significant portion of newly minted
LIRA to the creation of TB Tokens and securing them in a dedicated
vault, the LIRA ecosystem promotes stability and value appreciation.
Owning TB Tokens grants users the opportunity to maximize their profit
potential within the LIRA ecosystem, further strengthening the overall
economic and financial independence offered by the project.
