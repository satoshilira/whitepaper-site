The YOSHI token is the cornerstone of the democratic, decentralize and free governance system of the LIRA ecosystem.

It has a defined total supply of 210,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 YOSHI tokens distributed as follows:

     5%  Team LIRA         -  10,500,000,000,000,000,000,000   (1.05x10^22)    (pre-minted)
     5%  Liquidity         -  10,500,000,000,000,000,000,000   (1.05x10^22)    (pre-minted)
    10%  Pre-sale          -  21,000,000,000,000,000,000,000    (2.1x10^22)    (pre-minted)
    20%  Airdrop           -  42,000,000,000,000,000,000,000    (4.2x10^22)    (pre-minted)
    60%  Incentive Staking - 126,000,000,000,000,000,000,000   (1.26x10^23)

The amount minted per block is 13,808,219,200,000 YOSHI and the block production halving occurs every time 50% of the remaining coins to be mionted are reached.

The first halving occurs at 63,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (6.3x10^22) minted coins and subsequent halvings occur at intervals of 
31,500,000,000,000,000,000,000 (3.15x10^22) minted coins, 15,750,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1.575x10^22) minted coins, etcetera.

The YOSHI token will be used as the governance token, meaning that any decision to be made within the LIRA ecosystem will be decided by the community through voting. When a proposal is presented to the community, any user can participate in the voting process by sending their YOSHI tokens to the relevant vault for the proposal. Once the voting is complete, the LIRA protocol will declare the winning proposal.

All users who voted for rejected proposals will receive back 80% of their YOSHI tokens used for the voting process.
The remaining 20% will be split and distributed as follows: 

    80% will go to the users who voted for the approved proposal in the form of an airdrop
    20% will be split between the LIRA team and the LIRA ecosystem (10%, 90%)
