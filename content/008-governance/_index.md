DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, represent an innovative approach to governance and administration through the use of smart contracts based on the blockchain. These contracts, executed on a blockchain such as Ethereum, allow for the creation of completely decentralized and autonomous organizational structures managed by the community itself without the need for central intermediaries.

**Mechanism of Operation**
The governance model of a DAO is based on key principles that ensure participation, transparency, and autonomy. Here's an overview of the functioning mechanism:

**Smart Contracts**
 The DAO is built on smart contracts, which are executable codes on the blockchain. These contracts define the operational rules of the DAO, including decision-making processes, token distribution, and fund management.

**Token Governance**
 DAO members hold tokens that grant them voting rights and participation in decisions. The number of tokens held by a member may influence the weight of their decisions in governance.

**Proposals and Voting** 
Members can propose ideas, decisions, or changes to existing rules. Proposals are voted on by the community using tokens held by individual members. Decisions are then automatically implemented through smart contracts on the blockchain.

**Upgrades and Evolution**
 The nature of DAOs allows for continuous evolution. Members can propose changes to smart contracts or the rules themselves, enabling the DAO to adapt to the evolving needs of the community.

Implementing a DAO provides transparency, censorship resistance, and decentralization.
